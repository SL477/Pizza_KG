\chapter{Ontology Modelling}

For my knowledge graph I have chosen to seperate out the country, province, City, restaurant and menu items into different classes.
This is so that repeating data is generally only stored once and to enable us to model the hiarchy of the data.
For the pizzas I have modelled various different types of pizza and their ingredients.
In theory this should let us reaon the type of a pizza from the ingredients. I also added in generic types of pizza, e.g. vegetarian, meat.

I put in the various relationships between the data, with their opposite types. Such as City has Restaurant and City Located in.
I also put in various data properties which did not need to go into the class hiarchy, such as the latitude and longditude of the restaurant.

\chapter{Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph}

For getting the state and country data no entity resolution was needed.
For the cities, some more creativity was needed to match some of the cities up after the bulk of them were matched automatically from using SPARQL to get lists of cities from DBPedia.

To resolve the entities I built a map with words to look for in the menu name back to the ontology URL. I did the same thing for the ingredients, but split them up as well.

\chapter{SPARQL \& Reasoning}
